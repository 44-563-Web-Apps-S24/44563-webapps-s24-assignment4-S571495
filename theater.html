                    The policy of France is clear and definite; the French know
                what they want: it is to skin those German sausages, but the Germans
                must sing another song; France is not the only thorn in their flesh.

                Nonsense! In my opinion the Germans are cowards and the
                French are the same. They are showing their teeth at one another, but
                you can take my word for it, they will not do more than that; they'll
                never fight!

                Why should they fight? Why all these congresses, this arming and
                expense? Do you know what I would do in their place? I would catch all
                the dogs in the kingdom and inoculate them with Pasteur's serum, then I
                would let them loose in the enemy's country, and the enemies would all
                go mad in a month.

                laughing] But how is this, gentlemen? Here we are talking Germany,
                Germany, and never a word about vodka! Repetatur! [He fills three

                No, no, these cucumbers are better; every wise man since the
                creation of the world has been trying to invent something better than
                a salted cucumber, and not one has succeeded. [To PETER] Peter, go and
                fetch some more cucumbers. And Peter, tell the cook to make four little
                onion pasties, and see that we get them hot.
