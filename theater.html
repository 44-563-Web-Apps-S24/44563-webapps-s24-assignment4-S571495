            LEBEDIEFF. The policy of France is clear and definite; the French know
            what they want: it is to skin those German sausages, but the Germans
            must sing another song; France is not the only thorn in their flesh.
            <br>
            SHABELSKI. Nonsense! In my opinion the Germans are cowards and the
            French are the same. They are showing their teeth at one another, but
            you can take my word for it, they will not do more than that; they'll
            never fight!
            <br>
            BORKIN. Why should they fight? Why all these congresses, this arming and
            expense? Do you know what I would do in their place? I would catch all
            the dogs in the kingdom and inoculate them with Pasteur's serum, then I
            would let them loose in the enemy's country, and the enemies would all
            go mad in a month.
            <br>
            LEBEDIEFF. [Laughing] His head is small, but the great ideas are hidden
            away in it like fish in the sea!
            <br>
            SHABELSKI. Oh, he is a genius.
            <br>    
            LEBEDIEFF. Heaven help you, Misha, you are a funny chap. [He stops
            laughing] But how is this, gentlemen? Here we are talking Germany,
            Germany, and never a word about vodka! Repetatur! [He fills three
            glasses] Here's to you all! [He drinks and eats] This herring is the
            best of all relishes.
            <br>
            SHABELSKI. No, no, these cucumbers are better; every wise man since the
            creation of the world has been trying to invent something better than
            a salted cucumber, and not one has succeeded. [To PETER] Peter, go and
            fetch some more cucumbers. And Peter, tell the cook to make four little
            onion pasties, and see that we get them hot.
            <br>
            PETER goes out.
