                    Caviar is good with vodka, but it must be prepared with
                    skill. Take a quarter of a pound of pressed caviar, two little onions,
                    and a little olive oil; mix them together and put a slice of lemon on
                    top--so! Lord! The very perfume would drive you crazy!

                Roast snipe are good too, but they must be cooked right. They
                should first be cleaned, then sprinkled with bread crumbs, and roasted
                until they will crackle between the teeth--crunch, crunch!
